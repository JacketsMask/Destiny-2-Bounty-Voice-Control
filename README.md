# BountyVoiceTracker

A prototype console application that utilizes the .NET Framework [System.Speech.Recognition library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.speech.recognition.speechrecognitionengine) and custom [Grammar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.speech.recognition.grammar) to allow for adding and removing Destiny 2 Bounties from a locally tracked list.

**NOTE:** This application does not interact with the Destiny 2 application, the Destiny API, or the internet in any way.
